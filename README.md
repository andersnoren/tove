# Tove

Tove is a fun and colorful multi-purpose block theme built entirely around Full Site Editing. It's designed with cafes and restaurants in mind, but thanks to the layout features of Full Site Editing, you can easily adapt it for any type of website. Tove bundles over 40 Block Patterns to get you started, including six different header designs and seven different footer designs.

## Contributing
Do you have a bug report or feature request? Feel free to create an issue, and I’ll take a look at it. You can also create a pull request if you have a solution ready. 

Keep in mind that I maintain my themes in my spare time. Even though I deeply appreciate any and all contributions, I can’t guarantee I’ll take a look at them quickly.
