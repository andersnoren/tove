	Theme Name: Tove
    Text Domain: tove
	Version: 0.4.2
	Description: Tove is a fun and colorful multi-purpose block theme built entirely around the Full Site Editing features in WordPress 5.9. It's designed with cafes and restaurants in mind, but thanks to the layout features of Full Site Editing, you can easily adapt it for any type of website. Tove bundles over 40 Block Patterns to get you started, including six different header designs and seven different footer designs. You must have the Gutenberg plugin active (version 11.8 or newer) to use Tove before WordPress 5.9 is released, and there may be breaking changes in both Gutenberg and Tove up until that point.
